# Question of hacker rank if else

# Task
# Given an integer, n , perform the following conditional actions:

# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
# If n is even and greater than , print Not Weird
# Input Format

# A single line containing a positive integer,n .

# Constraints
 #1 <= n <= 100
# Output Format

# Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.
